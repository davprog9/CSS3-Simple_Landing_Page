	<h1>The story of BMW</h1>
	<div class="longtext">
		<p>BMW Automobiles
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly known as Bavarian Motor Works, BMW or BMW AG, is a German automobile, motorcycle and engine manufacturing company founded in 1916.

BMW is headquartered in Munich, Bavaria. It also owns and produces Mini cars, and is the parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. BMW produces motorcycles under BMW Motorrad. In 2012, the BMW Group produced 1,845,186 automobiles and 117,109 motorcycles across all of its brands. BMW is part of the “German Big 3” luxury automakers, along with Audi and Mercedes-Benz, which are the three best-selling luxury automakers in the world.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty. The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production in 1923, once the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted, followed by automobiles in 1928–29.

The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, it was based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.

BMW’s first significant aircraft engine (and commercial product of any sort) was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance. With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered “emergency fighter”, the Heinkel He 162 Spatz.</p>
	<h2>1958</h2>
	<p>By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully by some of Germany’s ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. The rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta were bought; the tiny cars themselves were to be powered by a modified form of BMW’s own motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft since 1959 is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.</p>
	<h2>1966</h2>
	<p>BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas’ development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications, although some saw Glas’ Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW’s biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel. The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.</p>
	<h2>1992</h2>
	<p>In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.</p>
	<h2>2009</h2>
	<p>Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years. He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle’s former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.</p>
	<h2>2012</h2>
	<p>In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com. Rankings are based upon aspects such as “people’s willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products.”</p>

		<h2>BMW M5 E60 2005-2010</h2>
		<p>The E60 M5 was introduced in 2005, with a V10 engine and 7-speed transmission linking the car with the BMW Sauber Formula One program. The E60 M5 was the world's first production sedan to use a V10 petrol engine. The M5 was also built in the E61 Touring (wagon) body style, which was only sold in Europe. The E63/E64 M6 coupé and convertible are based on a shortened version of the M5 chassis and largely use the same mechanical components.</p>
		<h2>BMW M5 F10 2011-2016</h2>
		<p>The F10 M5 was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show and sales began in November 2011. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged V8 engine, making it the first turbocharged M5 model. The gearbox in most markets is a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission marking the first time an M5 has used a dual-clutch transmission. A traditional 6-speed manual transmission was also available in the United States.</p>
		<h2>BMW M5 F90 2017-Present</h2>
		<p>The F90 M5 is based on the G30 5 Series and uses an all-wheel drive powertrain, being the first time that an M5 has not been rear-wheel drive.[85][86] However the all-wheel drive system is biased towards the rear wheels and be configured to send power to the rear wheels only (if the electronic stability control is disabled).</p>
		<h2>BMW M6 E24 1983-1924</h2>
		<p>In 1983, BMW took the M88/3 Straight-six engine, a modified version of the M88/1 from the BMW M1 and put it in the E24 chassis of the 6 Series, thus creating the M635CSi (dubbed simply "M6" in North America and Japan).The first generation of the M6 was critically acclaimed throughout its lifespan for its elegant, aggressive "shark-nose" styling, its luxury equipment and its performance. A top speed in excess of 158 mph (255 km/h)[3] made the European M635CSi the second fastest BMW automobile ever built next to the M1. However, Rug Cunningham, of Cunningham BMW, ran a bone stock 1987 U.S. M6 in the La Carrera Classic Race in Mexico in 1989 and recorded an indicated top speed of 176 mph (283 km/h).</p>
		<h2>BMW M6 E64 2005-2010 </h2>
		<p>The BMW M6 concept made its debut at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It was based on the BMW E63/E64 6 Series, introduced in 2004. The M6 shared the same uneven firing 5.0 L V10 S85 engine and SMG III gearbox with the E60 M5 that produces 373 kW (507 PS; 500 bhp) at 7,750 rpm and 520 N⋅m (384 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,100 rpm.[8]

Manufacturer claimed performance included a 0-62 mph (100 km/h) acceleration time of 4.6 seconds.[8] Road & Track measured the 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time at 4.1 seconds.[9] The top speed was limited to 250 km/h (155 mph). De limited top speed amounted to 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional M-driver's package.</p>
		<h2>BMW M6 F13 2012-2018</h2>
		<p>The new model is based on the BMW F12/F13 and shares its 7-speed M-DCT gearbox, BMW S63 V8 engine and other technology with the BMW M5 (F10). The M6 coupé has a carbon-fibre roof and other weight saving measures, making it 20 kg (44 lb) lighter than the M5, however it is 140 kg (309 lb) heavier than its predecessor. The M6 Convertible is 50 kg (110 lb) heavier than the previous M6 Convertible.

The official claimed performance figures state the acceleration from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph) with the de-limited top speed being 305 km/h (190 mph) with the optional M-driver's package. The design language of the M6 was similar to the then M series cars. The front of the car has a newly designed M kidney grille with an “M6” badge – a homage to the first generation of the M6</p>
		<h2>BMW X5 E53 1999-2006</h2>
		<p>The BMW E70 is the second generation X5 crossover. It replaced the BMW X5 (E53) in November 2006. The second generation X5 features many new technological advancements including BMW's iDrive system as standard equipment and, for the first time in a BMW, an optional third row seat raising passenger capacity to seven.

The branding for the X5 from late 2008 onwards follows the new BMW nomenclature scheme, for example the X5 3.0si is now called the X5 xDrive30i, and the X5 4.8i is called the X5 xDrive48i. In 2010 BMW added the new CIC hard drive iDrive system, replacing the DVD based CCC system.</p>
